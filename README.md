# Scrivomatic: Scrivener & *Pandoc\{omatic\}*

## Introduction 

[Scrivener](http://literatureandlatte.com) is a program for all kinds of writers, handling the structural organisation *and* constructive process of writing like nothing else. You write and organise your text, ideas, figures and reference materials all in one place without having to worry about the final "look". The final "look" is handled by a process called compiling, where you choose the output format and select the contents with great flexibility. Although Scrivener uses rich-text internally in the editor, it has very good integration with plain text [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) during compile. Compiling your Scrivener projects via Markdown offers numerous advantages over rich-text: it creates more structured, beautiful and flexible documents without lots of fussing in a Word processor or layout software. For example: 

* Binder headings are properly converted into semantic heading levels.
* Figures and figure captions get proper styling.
* Semantically styled block quotes, code blocks (with full syntax highlighting), and many inline styles.
* Mathematical equations are properly parsed to multipe output formats.
* You can generate multiple outputs (EPub,HTML,PDF,LaTeX,DOCX,ODT) from a single compile; and trigger other tools to automate many workflows.
* You can use a Microsoft Word/LibreOffice base file to provide customised styles for your documents without any fussing in a word processor afterwards.
* For academics, by utilising [Pandoc (a markdown processor)](http://pandoc.org/index.html), you can *automagically generate a full [Bibliography](http://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#citations)*. 
* For LaTeX users, there is a lot of flexibility using templates and meta-data.
* For technical writers, you can add semantic custom block and span structures.

This save you lots of time, especially if you compile regularly during collaborative editing. So there are many benefits to compiling to markdown.  

[Pandoc](http://pandoc.org/index.html) is the preferred complment to Scrivener, but because of its great flexibility, it has many settings. To simplify this, there are tools that manage Pandoc via the use of "templates" ([Pandocomatic](https://heerdebeer.org/Software/markdown/pandocomatic/) or [Panzer](https://github.com/msprev/panzer)). For each output we would like to set up, the template specifies all the options, variables and metadata in a configuration file. They also allow you to run pre– and post–processors for more complex workflows (i.e. you could automate moving a HTML file to a web server after compile). To use the templates with Scrivener, you specify its name in the front–matter, and all the settings are activated when Pandoc is run without any other fussing!

### TL;DR
1. Install Pandoc and Pandocomatic.
2. Configure one or more templates; you can base them on mine [shared below](#configuration).
3. In Scrivener, use a **front-matter** document containing the required settings and compile to Multimarkdown.
4. Scrivener's compile process automatically triggers pandocomatic to automagically create the final output(s).

## Requirements 

Apart from **Scrivener**, you need to install **Pandoc** and **Pandocomatic**. This requires a minimal amount of typing into the macOS terminal. You can install Pandoc [manually](http://pandoc.org/installing.html), but it is generally better to use [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) to install Pandoc, as it can keep everything up to date. So first,follow the [instructions to install Homebrew](https://brew.sh/), and then install pandoc through the `brew` command:

```bash
> brew install pandoc pandoc-citeproc pandoc-crossref
```

This will get you a working Pandoc. You should run the command `brew update` every so often to ensure these tools are *kept* up-to-date.

You use Ruby's `gem` command (built in to macOS) to install Pandocomatic (putting the binary in `/usr/local/bin`):

```bash
> sudo gem install paru pandocomatic -u /usr/local/bin
```

To keep both Pandoc and Pandocomatic *up-to-date*, you can run the update commands like so every week or so:

```bash
> brew update; sudo gem update
```


## Configuration 

The most important folder for this workflow is the Pandoc data directory: `$HOME/.pandoc`. It is easiest to organise your templates, filters and other files there. It is a hidden folder by default, so you can use the terminal to manage it, or learn [how to unhide it first](https://www.google.com/search?q=unhide+folder+mac) if you will use Finder.

You can [explore my working Pandoc folder here](https://github.com/iandol/dotfiles/tree/master/pandoc). It is comprised of a series of subfolders organised into the files Pandoc will use. You can also *install* my Pandoc folder to your `$HOME/.pandoc` folder using the following terminal command:

```bash
svn export https://github.com/iandol/dotfiles/trunk/pandoc $HOME/.pandoc
```

You can look through a simplified [`pandocomatic.yaml` here](https://github.com/iandol/scrivomatic/blob/master/pandocomatic.yaml); this won't work without modification, but it gives you an idea of how this configuration works. The `pandocomatic.yaml` file resides in the Pandoc data directory.

Normally all the custom templates reside in `$HOME/.pandoc/templates`, filters in `$HOME/.pandoc/filters`. For bibliographies, I prefer to symlink my Bibliography.bib into in `$HOME/.pandoc` and my Journal style files in `$HOME/.pandoc/csl`. 

### Tips for writing while in Scrivener 

With Scrivener 3's new [styles system](http://www.literatureandlatte.com/blog/?p=1094), there is a huge change to how you can write with markdown. You can use paragraph styles (like blockquote), and inline styles (like emphasis or superscript) as you would writing in rich text (no need to add markdown syntax in the editor). During the new [compile](http://www.literatureandlatte.com/blog/?p=1097), Scrivener can add a prefix/suffix to create the required plain-text markdown. So for example, create an inline bold style called `strong`, and in compile set the prfix to \*\* and suffix to \*\* and Scrivener does the conversion to markdown from the style. In Scrivener 2, you can still use formatting presets, but these will always be stripped out during the compile, so you need to write the markdown directly in the editor. I used to use formatting presets to visualise markdown structure in Scrivener 2 (block quotes, code blocks, lists, tables, figure captions). But in Scrivener 3, I now use styles both to *visualise* structure **and** to *generate* the Pandoc markup itself:  

![Figure 1 — The cursor shows **strong** and blockquote are both applied. Note whitespace is visualised and styles are used to give visual structure to the Scrivener writing environment. These will be transformed into the correct markdown on compile…](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iandol/scrivomatic/Scrivener3/images/2.png)  

You can download my customised Scrivener 3 [compile preset here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iandol/scrivomatic/Scrivener3/Scrivomatic.scrformat). Install it and you can see how I convert styles to markdown.  

**One setting is very useful in Scrivener**: Show invisible characters; this is because markdown is sensitive to whitespace. You should aim to use whitespace consistently: For a new paragraph and between blocks of content I always use \[space\]\[space\]\[return\]\[return\]. It is automatic for me and showing invisible characters makes potential formatting issues when compiling simple to fix.

**Use the Binder for all document structure**: try not to not use markdown \# headings within the text itself but form the document hierarchy in the Binder. Scrivener is great at compiling  the levels of the Binder structure in to the correct heading styles.  

**Cross-referencing**: I use Scrivener links to cross-reference documents, and Scrivener's placeholder tags to cross-reference figures and equations. But Pandoc does have several cross-referrencing filters and you could also use these.

## Compiling your Project: 

In Scrivener, I prefer to first remove any Compile metadata specified in the user interface so it does not interfere with the Pandoc metadata. I create a **front–matter** document with a configuration block right at the top. In this example, two templates are specified, and `pandocomatic` will run Pandoc twice to generate both a HTML & DOCX file from the same single Scrivener compile:

```yaml
---
title: "<$projecttitle>"
author:
  - John Doe
  - Joanna Doe
keywords: 
  - test
  - pandoc
pandocomatic_:
  use-template:
    - paper-with-refs-html
    - paper-with-refs-docx
---

```

This **front–matter** should be compiled **as–is** in the Scrivener compile settings (indentation in the metadata block must be **spaces**and not **tabs**). The Pandocomatic configuration file could look something like this for the DOCX template specified above; generating a bibliography using the APA style (with linked citations) and a table of contents amongst other things:

```yaml
  paper-with-refs-docx:
    pandoc:
      from: markdown
      to: docx
      standalone: true
      filter: pandoc-citeproc
      bibliography: core.bib
      citation-style: csl/apa.csl
      reference-docx: templates/custom.docx
      dpi: 300
      toc: true
    metadata: 
      notes-after-punctuation: false 
      link-citations: true
```

In Scrivener, you select Multimarkdown as the compile document output and select a compile format that configures a [post-processing tool](#scrivomatic-post-processing-script) to run pandocomatic automatically.

## Scrivomatic post-processing script 

![Figure 2 — Scrivener's processing panel in the compile preset.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iandol/scrivomatic/Scrivener3/images/processing.png)  
I've built a simple script, [`scrivomatic`](https://github.com/iandol/scrivomatic/raw/master/scrivomatic), that runs from Scrivener's post-processing panel and ensures the search path and environment are automatically added. **You can also run pandocomatic directly**, but you may need to ensure the `Environment` path is set up so Scrivener can find all the files and the other tools properly. `scrivomatic` handles this automatically...

It adds the paths for tools installed via `homebrew` and `MacTeX`; and if you've used [rbenv](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv) or [conda](https://www.continuum.io/anaconda-overview) to install pandocomatic/panzer it adds these paths too. It can also generate a log file of the conversion (so you can check for missing references etc.). Save the [`scrivomatic`](https://github.com/iandol/scrivomatic/raw/master/scrivomatic) script, move it to a directory on your path, and make sure it can be executed like so:

```bash
mkdir -p $HOME/bin
mv $HOME/Downloads/scrivomatic $HOME/bin
chmod 755 $HOME/bin/scrivomatic
```

You can also run scrivomatic from the command line:

```
Usage: scrivomatic --input FILE [additional options]
    -i, --input FILE                 Input file?
    -o, --output [file]              Output file? Can be ignored for pandocomatic.
    -t, --to [format]                Pandoc Format? Can be ignored for pandocomatic.
    -c, --command [command]          Command to use? Default is pandocomatic
    -p, --path [dirpath]             Path to Search for Commands?
    -b, --build                      If LaTeX output, try to run latexmk
    -v, --[no-]verbose               Verbose output?
    -h, --help                       Prints this help!
```

And I include an [Alfred workflow](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iandol/scrivomatic/Scrivener3/scrivomatic.alfredworkflow) so you can run scrivomatic directly from markdown files selected by Alfred:

## Working with Bookends
[Bookends](http://www.sonnysoftware.com/) is an excellent reference manager for macOS which can be configured to output temporary citations for Scrivener in a format fully compatible with Pandoc. To set this up I'd first follow the nice tutorial here:

[BSAG » Bookends and Pandoc](https://www.rousette.org.uk/archives/bookends-and-pandoc/)

To export your references as a BIB file you can do tht manually from the Bookends GUI. However, I prefer to do this automatically every day or so using [this applescript](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iandol/bookends-tools/master/source/toBibTeX.applescript), you can specify an output folder and comma-separated list of groups via command-line input. This script can also be run directly from [Bookends Tools for Alfred](https://github.com/iandol/bookends-tools). I would recommend setting the option to save a JSON instead of BibTeX as Pandoc parses the JSON ~3X faster when processing documents, and with a big reference database that can save quite a lot of time!
